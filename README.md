Welcome to Duck Duck Choose, a game where you choose a duck flock's luck! Take hold of an escaped banana train and deal with difficult moral choices. The option to divert the train in order to save one group of ducks at the expense of another is presented at each track. Does one dancing cactus have a higher value than three cute ducklings? Every choice involves calculations, and morality expressed at its peak. Don't choose the correct one.
