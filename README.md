Hi üëã

# Duck Duck Choose ü¶Ü

Welcome to **Duck Duck Choose**, a moral-choice game where you decide the fate of a duck flock.  
Take control of an **escaped banana train** and face seriously absurd decisions at every track.  
Your goal is simple: **Divert the train**, but remember, every choice saves some and ends others.

## Gameplay üéÆ

At each junction, you‚Äôll see two groups of potential victims.  
Do you save the *dancing cactus* or the *three cute ducklings*?  
Every round challenges you to weigh absurd logic against emotional chaos.

## Philosophy Behind the Game

> ‚ÄúDoes one dancing cactus have more value than three ducklings?‚Äù  
> That‚Äôs the kind of question this game makes you *not* answer.  

Every choice combines **math and morality**, surrounded by chaos.  
We want players to feel the weight of meaningless decisions  
and perhaps laugh at the absurdity of it all.  

**Don‚Äôt choose the right one.**  
There isn‚Äôt one.
